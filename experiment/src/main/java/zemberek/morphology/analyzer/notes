is "balkabakçık" correct?

"balkabaklılar" -> current mechanism will fail. After derivation, some root attributes should be
removed. Check this after implementing Noun-->lI--->Adj work.

imlicitPlural and implicitDative etc. attributes should be added to master dictionary items.


Consider adding Conditions.containsAny() and Conditions.containsNone() for a group of conditions.

Instead of using "su" in Morphotactics, A "RootGroup" identifier can be used. Same exceptions
may apply to "akarsu" as well. Or, groups can be Sets of Dictionary objects. So that Conditions.containsAny
etc can be used.

Consider making "-cağız" a separate morpheme. Not Dim.

Should we remove words that exist in TDK with `-li` suffix? "zehirli, sulu" etc. They create ambiguity.

We may not need `head` in SearchPath

Noun->Zero Verb derivation correct and false positive tests -> elmalarımdı elmamdım elmandım elmamdır.
how about implicitplural derivation etc?

"JustLike" does not sound right. "odun-su". Resemblance?

"elmayayım" "armudasın" "armudasındır" "elmamımdır", "elmalarlar" seems incorrect but Oflazer accepts.

"odun-lar-dır" vs "odun-dur-lar" Oflazer gives same analysis for both.
(elma+Noun+A3sg+Pnon+Nom^DB+Verb+Zero+Pres+A3pl+Cop)  Should we allow "odun-dur-lar"?

"elmalar" now also has a Verb result. Such as
elma:Noun + A3sg + Pnon + Nom + Zero + Verb + Pres + lar:A3pl
Example: "Bunlar o elmalar.". However this actually generates a lot of ambiguity. Should we disallow?

should we accept bot "yeşilimsi" and "yeşilsi" (currently we do)

oflazer does not have `onlar` as a pronoun. it uses `o` and A3pl

Oflzer accepts bunla =   [(bu:bu) (Pron,Demons;A3sg+Pnon+Inst:nla)]
               bununla = [(bu:bu) (Pron,Demons;A3sg+Pnon+Inst:nunla)]
should there be a `bunla`?

Oflazer parses `bunlu`and `bunsuz` as separate adjectives.

herkes is implicitly plural. Perhaps we should also accept `herkesler` as same.

Should RootAttrubute and Root contitions also check if there is no derivation?

----

annemler, annenler etc can be resoved with implicitPlural, ImplicitP1sg and ImplicitP2sg attributes.
However, for making morphotactics work easier, A third property (FamilyMember?) can be added.

Currently we do not add root "Noun" state to the SearchPath. We should.
