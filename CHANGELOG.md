CHANGE LOG
==========

## 0.10.0

- Fixed a bad memory leak caused my not removing elements from a Map structure. [87] (https://github.com/ahmetaa/zemberek-nlp/issues/87)
- TurkishMorphology can be configured for not using cache and UnidentifiedTokenAnaysis.
- Re-introduce lang-id module. This provides a simple language identification API.
- Add normalization module. So far it only provides fast Levenshtein distance dictionary matching.
- Dictionary fixes.
- Added city, village and district names.
- System can generates full jar containing all zemberek modules.
- Added an experiment module. This module will be used for experimental features.
- Speedup Antlr based tokenizer. Now it is three times faster again. [89] (https://github.com/ahmetaa/zemberek-nlp/issues/89)
- Eliminate static cache from TurkishMorphology [86] (https://github.com/ahmetaa/zemberek-nlp/issues/86)
- Some inputs may cause excessive hypothesis generation during analysis [88] (https://github.com/ahmetaa/zemberek-nlp/issues/88)
- Proper Nouns ending -nk or -og should not have Voicing attribute automatically. [83] (https://github.com/ahmetaa/zemberek-nlp/issues/83)
- "foo \nabc" should be tokenized as "foo \n abc" [69] (https://github.com/ahmetaa/zemberek-nlp/issues/83)
- There are some name changes.
  TurkishMorphology.TurkishMorphParserBuilder -> TurkishMorphology.Builder
  UnidentifiedTokenAnalyzer parse -> analyze  

## 0.9.3

- Improved morphological analysis coverage by cross checking with Oflazer-Analyzer. For this, a list of more than 7 million words are extracted from a 2 billion word corpora. Then a list of words that can be analyzed only by Oflazer-Analyzer is generated and Zemberek is fixed as much possible.  
- Breaking change: zemberek.morphology.parse package is now zemberek.morphology.analysis [67] (https://github.com/ahmetaa/zemberek-nlp/issues/67)
- Breaking change: Several classes are renamed.  
   TurkishWordParserGenerator -> TurkishMorphology  
   SentenceMorphParse -> SentenceAnalysis  
   MorphParse -> WordAnalysis  
   WordParser -> WordAnalyzer [67] (https://github.com/ahmetaa/zemberek-nlp/issues/67)
- Breaking change: Methods with name "parse" are renamed to "analyze". [67] (https://github.com/ahmetaa/zemberek-nlp/issues/67)
- Custom Antlr dependency is removed. We now use latest stable Antlr version. We decided this because maintaining a patched version of Antlr was time consuming. We were using such a fork because original version was around 3 times slower. But current speed is good enough. We may remove Antlr dependency altogether in future releases because tokenization should be less strict and it should not do detailed classification. [68] (https://github.com/ahmetaa/zemberek-nlp/issues/68)
- Add Oflazer compatible secondary POS information for Postp.  [65] (https://github.com/ahmetaa/zemberek-nlp/issues/65)
- Tokenization problem after capital letters after apostrophe. [64] (https://github.com/ahmetaa/zemberek-nlp/issues/64)
- Cannot parse diyebil-, diyecek-, diyen-. [61] (https://github.com/ahmetaa/zemberek-nlp/issues/61)
- Proper nouns should not have Voicing attribute automatically. [57] (https://github.com/ahmetaa/zemberek-nlp/issues/57)
- Can parse reçelsi but not reçelimsi. [54] (https://github.com/ahmetaa/zemberek-nlp/issues/54)
- Cannot parse maviceydi, yeşilcedir. [53] (https://github.com/ahmetaa/zemberek-nlp/issues/53)
- Cannot parse "soyadları" [55] (https://github.com/ahmetaa/zemberek-nlp/issues/55)
- Wrong start and stop indexes for abbreviation words on tokenization. [51] (https://github.com/ahmetaa/zemberek-nlp/issues/51)
- Fixes in caching mechanism in TurkishMorphology.
- Added a dependency module. It does not perform parsing yet.
