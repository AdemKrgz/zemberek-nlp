is "balkabakçık" correct?

"balkabaklılar" -> current mechanism will fail. After derivation, some root attributes should be
removed. Check this after implementing Noun-->lI--->Adj work.

imlicitPlural and implicitDative etc. attributes should be added to master dictionary items.


Consider adding Conditions.containsAny() and Conditions.containsNone() for a group of conditions.

Instead of using "su" in Morphotactics, A "RootGroup" identifier can be used. Same exceptions
may apply to "akarsu" as well. Or, groups can be Sets of Dictionary objects. So that Conditions.containsAny
etc can be used.

Consider making "-cağız" a separate morpheme. Not Dim.

Should we remove words that exist in TDK with `-li` suffix? "zehirli, sulu" etc. They create ambiguity.

We may not need `head` in SearchPath

Noun->Zero Verb derivation correct and false positive tests -> elmalarımdı elmamdım elmandım elmamdır.
how about implicitplural derivation etc?

"JustLike" does not sound right. "odun-su". Resemblance?

"elmamımdır", "elmalarlar" seems incorrect but Oflazer accepts.

"odun-lar-dır" vs "odun-dur-lar" Oflazer gives same analysis for both.
(elma+Noun+A3sg+Pnon+Nom^DB+Verb+Zero+Pres+A3pl+Cop)  Should we allow "odun-dur-lar"?

"elmalar" now also has a Verb result. Such as
elma:Noun + A3sg + Pnon + Nom + Zero + Verb + Pres + lar:A3pl
Example: "Bunlar o elmalar.". However this actually generates a lot of ambiguity. Should we disallow?

should we accept bot "yeşilimsi" and "yeşilsi" (currently we do)

oflazer does not have `onlar` as a pronoun. it uses `o` and A3pl

Oflzer accepts bunla =   [(bu:bu) (Pron,Demons;A3sg+Pnon+Inst:nla)]
               bununla = [(bu:bu) (Pron,Demons;A3sg+Pnon+Inst:nunla)]
should there be a `bunla`?

Oflazer parses `bunlu`and `bunsuz` as separate adjectives.

herkes is implicitly plural. Perhaps we should also accept `herkesler` as same.

Should RootAttrubute and Root contitions also check if there is no derivation?

Oflazer does not offer A3pl+Pnon analysis for herkesler and öbürküler. We allow it.
is "öbürkülerim" ok?

Oflazer has pron+Quant and Noun forms for "kimse". kimseler only accepted for Noun or Pron->Verb+A3pl.
Here I decided to connect "kimse" pronoun to Name-A3sg and Name-A3pl states. This way all name
suffixes will apply but it will be a pronoun.

should we parse `nemiz, neniz (neyimiz, neyiniz)`

`kimlerimde` etc. sounds bad. Should we restrict?

Adjective "öbür" should not get any suffixes.

Added "falan, falanca" as personal pronoun. Oflazer does not.
Added "berili" as qunatitive pronoun. Oflazer does not.

Sak, uses "-leri" surface as A3pl+P3pl in "kendileri". Perhaps we should use that. Now we have "ler-i" A3pl+P3pl
I make changes for Reflexive and some Quantitive pronouns but not all are covered.

We do not allow zero->Verb+..+lar for pronouns. Oflazer does.

Oflazer does not anayze elmaymışımdır. we do.

Oflazer does not analyze elmaymışsa. we do

akarsu also behaves like su but maybe both `akarsum` and `akarsuyum` are accepted.

Oflazer uses Prog1 (Progressive 1) for -iyor and Prog2 fo `-makta` should they be combined?
Combining may create ambiguity for generation. Perhaps generation should offer multiple solutions anyway.

Oflzer uses `Pos` for Positive in verbs. I decided not to use it for now to reduce clutter.
Perhaps we should get rid of Pnon as well.

Some verbs can have "-ir" suffix to make it Causative. Piş-ir, kaç-ır, şiş-ir, uç-ur.
There are two ways of handling those.
a) Add it as a separate verb without tagging implicit Causative.
b) like Oflazer, make it causative. [pişirdi piş+Verb^DB+Verb+Caus+Pos+Past+A3sg]

Both "okuyun" and "okuyunuz" have Imp+P2pl analysis. Bu semantically they are a little different
Second one is "kind". Should we introduce another morpheme for it?

okuyamayabilir oflazer offers two Able derivation here. Able->Neg->Able. Perhaps second Able can be
considered as "probability" but surely this will create ambiguity for regular "Able", like "okuyabilir"

"yazıyormuşsak" should we allow? Oflazer does not.

Should we use different morphemes for Past and Narr after tenses (Hikaye, Rivayet)?

A3pl causes 4 analysis in Oflazer system:
"evleri"
ev+Noun+A3pl+Pnon+Acc
ev+Noun+A3pl+P3sg+Nom
ev+Noun+A3sg+P3pl+Nom
ev+Noun+A3pl+P3pl+Nom
Should we keep all? We currently do.

A3pl generates 4 analysis for compounds as well. But they are a little different
"zeytinyağları"
zeytinyağı+Noun+A3sg+P3pl+Nom
zeytinyağı+Noun+A3pl+P3sg+Nom
zeytinyağı+Noun+A3pl+P3pl+Nom
zeytinyağı+Noun+A3pl+Pnon+Nom // This one seems to be the different one. Perhaps here because

Inf1 -> Noun -> Verb may contain false positives.

aramaktayım ->  has ara:Verb + mak:Inf1 + Noun + A3sg + Pnon + ta:Loc + Zero + Verb + Pres + yım:A1sg solution
yazmalıyım -> yaz:Verb + ma:Inf2 + Noun + A3sg + Pnon + Nom + lı:With + Adj + Zero + Verb + Pres + yım:A1sg
yazmalıyız -> yaz:Verb + ma:Inf2 + Noun + A3sg + Pnon + Nom + lı:With + Adj + Zero + Verb + Pres + yız:A1pl
false positive? Oflazer accepts.

yazmalılar:
yaz:Verb + malı:Neces + lar:A3pl
yaz:Verb + ma:Inf2 + Noun + A3sg + Pnon + Nom + lı:With + Adj + Zero + Verb + Pres + lar:A3pl
yaz:Verb + ma:Inf2 + Noun + A3sg + Pnon + Nom + lı:With + Adj + Zero + Noun + lar:A3pl + Pnon + Nom
three solution is too much. Ofalzer offers:
yaz+Verb+Pos+Neces+A3pl
yaz+Verb+Pos^DB+Noun+Inf2+A3sg+Pnon+Nom^DB+Adj+With^DB+Noun+Zero+A3pl+Pnon+Nom


for "okumayacak" oflazer offers:
okumayacak	oku	+Verb+Neg+Fut+A3sg
okumayacak	oku	+Verb+Neg^DB+Adj+FutPart+Pnon  <-- This is odd. Oflzer normally does not
use possesive suffixes with Adjectives. First a noun derivation occurs. Same goes for
"okumayacağım"
okumayacağım	oku	+Verb+Neg+Fut+A1sg
okumayacağım	oku	+Verb+Neg^DB+Adj+FutPart+P1sg
okumayacağım	oku	+Verb+Neg^DB+Noun+FutPart+A3sg+P1sg+Nom

Do not allow Verb+PastPart->Noun->Verb+Pres+A1pl for "okmadığım"

After adding PhoneticAttribute CannotTerminate we may remove some ExpectWovel conditions from
Morphotactics

Oflazer does not solve Adj+Pnon for FuturePart.

Ness seems not a good name.

withoutHavingDoneSo, withoutBeingAbleToHaveDoneSo terrible names.

domatesinki
domates+Noun+A3sg+Pnon+Gen^DB+Pron+Rel+A3sg+Pnon+Nom  <-- this is interesting. Not yet added.

for okuyacaklardır,okumazlardır Oflazer gives single soluiton

Oflzer offers same output for gelecektirler and geleceklerdir. => +Verb+Pos+Fut+A3pl+Cop
Zemberek changes orders of A3pl and Cop

Equ suffix is dodgy. evimce.. evlerince etc.

Oflazer rejects "elmayalar" but accepts "elmayayım"

"yazacaklardırlar" we now accept it with
 yaz:Verb + acak:FutPart + Noun + lar:A3pl + Pnon + Nom + Zero + Verb + Pres + dır:Cop + lar:A3pl
 should we?

Oflazer does not have Related (-sAl) suffix. It contains words with that suffix such as "bilimsel"
If we will use Oflazer conversion, this will require some attention.

Should we parse okuyasıma, okuyasımda? Oflazer does.
+Verb+Pos^DB+Noun+FeelLike+A3sg+P1sg+Dat

suikasti or suikastı? TDK says second. Second is very common

okumuşken should probably has one analysis only.

yazasınız should have 2 solutions but has 3

should we accept elmaymışlar or elmasındalarmış? Oflazer doesnt

some typos appear AorPart+...+Loc such as "darılmazda" should be "darılmaz da". "çıkılırda"

remove some proper nouns that causes ambiguity and false positives. `Li, Hayir` etc.

we need to make "bizim" same as oflazer. Or, solve bizimki etc.

OFlazer does not use suffix for `gel-im, gid-im`. Includes them in the dictionary. Should we?

Should we accept "akşamdaki", "andaki", "yıldaki"

Some adverbs can derive to verbs such as:
şöyleydi şöyleyim
Some can derive but only for some suffixes
tesadüfendi, tesadüfenmiş, tesadüfendir

False analysis `olan` o:Adj + lan:Acquire + Verb + Imp + A2sg

her->noun root is incorrect.
diğer:Noun incorrect

bu: Noun incorrect, add Det

her:  Noun incorrect? add Det

size: Noun incorrect

masada -> prefer masa
----

Turkish location names dictionary may be generating false positives as it contains many weird names.
Consider not using it.

----

annemler, annenler etc can be resoved with implicitPlural, ImplicitP1sg and ImplicitP2sg attributes.
However, for making morphotactics work easier, A third property (FamilyMember?) can be added.

Currently we do not add root "Noun" state to the SearchPath. We should.
